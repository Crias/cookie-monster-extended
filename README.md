# cookie-monster-extended
Extension to Cookie Monster providing buttons to purchase the most efficient buildings.

[Click here](https://github.com/Aktanusa/CookieMonster) to check out the original Cookie Monster plugin.

Adds 3 buttons to the top navigation bar:

* **Buy Next**
  * *Buys next building by efficiency*
* **Buy 10**
  * *Buys up to 10 more buildings by efficiency*
* **Safety [ON/OFF]** 
  * *Toggles "safety" mode. When "Safety [ON]", purchases will not bring you below Frenzy+Lucky"*

To load the mod, create a bookmark and place the following as the content:

```
javascript: (function () {    Game.LoadMod('https://crias.github.io/cookie-monster-extended/cookie-monster-extension.js'); }());
```

Go to [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) then click the bookmark. You do not need to load Cookie Monster separately - this script also loads Cookie Monster.

**Please Note:** *If 'Cookie Monster' or 'Cookie Clicker' are updated, it may break this extension. If that happens feel free to let me know, or to submit a pull-request that updates the extension as necessary.*
